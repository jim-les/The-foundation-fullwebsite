                Nelson Mandela day was my most inspirational day in the month of July. Besides the great conversations Commemorating the heroic life of this African icon, spending a day at heshima.org with kids living with Cerebral Palsy and their parents, was a transformational experience. 
                <br>  The ecosystem created by parents who double as teachers, therapists, artisans making distinctive jewelry for income to sustain their lives and the organization was impeccable. 
               <br>  <br> 
                I love zero. This is my favorite number. There are infinite fascinating facts about zero. Did you know zero was discovered by Indians? This means prior to this discovery, negative numbers never existed. I can't imagine being a Mathematician without the negative scale. No wonder computers never existed then! You know our language can only be interpreted to computers in form of ones and zeros! Zero makes a difference. 
                <br>   <br> 
                I used to wonder why in a group of 70 children with Cerebral Palsy, each one exhibits a different form of disability; Impaired sight, hearing, limbs, flaccid or stiff muscles, drooling etc yet a group infected with Malaria, all members have similar signs and symptoms. I understood the reason for this disparity after learning about the cause of Cerebral Palsy. This results from the delay in oxygen supply to the brain of a new born baby during birth. The severity depends on the period of delay and the variation depends on the functionality of the section of the brain that is damaged. The 9 months of pregnancy may have been perfect, but the few milliseconds (rounded off to zero) during birth may result in cerebral condition and permanent conditions of disability depending on the severity. Zero Makes a difference. 
                <br>   <br> 
                Oxygen is scientifically represented with two zeros. It is the basis of our life. I always visualize this, two Oxygen atoms holding hands or hugging to form an oxygen molecule which sustains life. For the case of Cerebral Palsy, while these two are on their way to the brain of a new born baby, they encounter delays for some seconds on their way, resulting in lifetime consequences. How delicate can life get! Zero makes a difference.

                As a freshman, my first reality check in UoN came when we received our Pure Mathematics CAT results. The lecturer came to class and started reading registration numbers while distributing the papers. When I received mine, I had 07 out of 20. I folded my paper immediately like James Bond and hid it in my desk. Some of my friends wanted to see my marks but I turned down their advances. I couldn't stand the embarrassment. At the end of the class, the lecturer announced that the leading person had 09 out of 20 and a third of the students in the class had 00 out of 30. Suddenly, my paper resurfaced on the desk and went around my peers like a bullet. Zero makes a difference!
                <br>   <br> 
                Those days we branded Muindi Mbingu Street(the road separating American Wing from the rest of Main Campus), the Equator (Zero degrees). This name originated from the contrasting realities in the school of Engineering (American Wing) and the rest of the campus. Our timetables were packed. Men filled up most classes. My class had about 7 ladies out of 127 students. Zeros in test results were not abnormal. In our naughtiness, we attributed this to the abundance of Oxygen atoms attracted by the magnanimous knowledge we had on Quantum Physics. The other side of the 'Equator' had classes flooded with ladies 'dressed to kill'. Timetables were spaced out and provided plenty of time for tet at' te. Seemingly everyone scored A's in exams! Consequently, we referred to this side as 'Rest'. In Our world there were only two courses, Engineering and the 'Rest'. Zero makes a difference. 
                <br>   <br> 
                My best moments at UoN are the days we collaborated with the 'Rest' of the school to pull funds, buy ingredients and make Porridge and bake mandazis at Klabu to treat street families around University Way with a weekend breakfast. I used to wonder what difference it felt between being a homeless child in the street or a disabled child in a care home. This was the period when Elon Musk, Tesla had just launched the Model S Sedan. Everyone was mind blown about Elon's net worth. I remember postulating, everyone in the world has zeros, the difference is the place value (decimal point). If a human being is represented by a number, say one, and the zeros came before one, then one would be more likely to live in scarcity. If the zeros came after one...one could be Elon Musk depending on the number of zeros. A part of me always feels one hasn't really gone through a holistic school life experience unless they go through the University of Nairobi. If one doesn't, it's nil for them. Anyway, Zero makes a difference.

                One day the different parts of the body were having an argument to see which should be in charge.
                <br>   <br> 
                The brain said: ‘I do all the thinking, so I’m the most important and I should be the boss’.
                <br>   <br> 
                The eyes said: ‘I see everything and let the rest of you know where we are, so I’m the most important and I should be in charge’.
                <br>  The hands said: ‘Without me we wouldn’t be able to pick anything up or move anything. So I’m the most important and I should be in charge’.
                <br>   <br> 
                The stomach said: ‘I turn the food we eat into energy for the rest of you. Without me, we’d starve. So I’m the most important and I should be the boss’.
                <br>   <br> 
                The legs said: ‘Without me we wouldn’t be able to move anywhere. So I’m the most important and I should be in charge’.
                <br> Then the rectum spoke and insisted that it should be in charge.
                <br>   <br> 
                All the rest of the parts laughed and derided the very notion. The rectum wasn’t important. How could it possibly be in charge ?
                <br>   <br> 
                So, the rectum closed up. After a few days, the legs were all wobbly, the stomach was queasy, the hands were shaky, the eyes were watery and the brain couldn’t think straight. The other body parts soon agreed that they couldn’t take any more and that the rectum should be placed in charge.
                <br>   <br> 
                 At times all you need to be is an asshole to make a difference. Zero makes a difference!
                 <br>   <br> 
                Take a pen, write down two Zero i.e 00. Let the first zero represent your life before birth. Since we start counting age from your birthday, Let the second zero represent your 'life' after death. Your life is that tiny space between the two zeros. Assign a noble meaning on this tiny space. Zero makes a difference!
