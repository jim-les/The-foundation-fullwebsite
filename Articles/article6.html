                Passionate in his quest to provide easily for others the opportunities he sought after, Alex Ochieng is a steadfast and determined individual. We discuss what it’s like to find yourself between a rock and hard place, navigating the stereotypes placed around different career paths, and the need to step out of your comfort zone.

                <b>What drove you to pursue your BSc. Microbiology and Biotechnology degree?</b><br>
                Having applied to UoN, Maseno, KU and JKUAT for medicine and surgery, law, radiography, and journalism, I found myself settling for BSc. Microbiology and Biotechnology degree in UoN. This, ofcourse, was due to several factors at the time. Being amongst the top students in high school, the county chose where the students would go, and so I was placed in a different university. I received this information from one of my high school teachers after several attempts to revise my application with KUCCP which had met with failure. So, I decided to do an intervarsity transfer to UoN for Medicine & Surgery, or any biological course, and then do an interfaculty. Through the inter university transfer, I moved to UoN but when I joined, the only degree open was BSc. Microbiology and Biotechnology. At the time the school policy stated that you can not do an interfaculty if you are a beneficiary of intervarsity transfer. So, I had no option considering my family couldn’t afford to educate me through the self-sponsored program.
                <br><br>
                <b>How was it like to navigate that situation?</b><br>
                It was a very tough decision to make - growing up thinking of doing one thing, Medicine & Surgery, but having to do something else you’d never thought existed. I felt like a walking zombie in my first year but when I learnt that microbiology could lead to advanced Medicine and Surgery in the future, I began to develop an interest in the degree until my life dreams realigned towards art in my second year.
                <br><br>
                <b>What birthed the idea of Gamers Groove Entertainment Corp.?</b><br>
                After highschool, I founded a charity organisation that aimed at advocating for peaceful elections and putting an end to youth manipulation by politicians and standing up against corruption. We were about 100+ youth and would meet regularly. Unfortunately, with tension and constant threats from authorities during the 2017 elections, many left the group due to threats of arrest with claims we’re organising a youth revolution or coup. This group transformed from Kenya National Pioneers Youth Association to Friends To Keep to One World Foundation to Peer Mentors Association Kenya and finally to now, Gamers Charity Foundation where we’d hold festivals, institutional and corporate mentorship sessions, cleaning projects and community service together with my friends. Coming to UoN opened doors for yet a greater opportunity. Having been a multi-talented individual in highschool, I wanted to continue with art too. I remember performing stand-up comedy only once during my first week in an MCCU orientation meeting and that was all. The frustrations grew even more when I joined a comedy academy that promised endless opportunities only to realise it was a scheme to acquire cheaper marketing labour. I quit! This prompted me into founding a talent company, Got Game Talent Battle (GGTB), for I believed I am a go-getter and didn’t get the opportunities despite pushing hard. What about thousands of youth out there burning with the same spirit? - GGTB was for them!
                <br><br>
                GGTB not only gave us a platform to perform but also manage art and so we needed marketing. We couldn’t get airtime from media houses and this prompted us to launch a youtube channel, Gamers TV (formerly Gamers Talk Show) where we’d end up introducing talk shows about social, political, academic, economical aspects of life amongst other things.
                <br><br>
                Gamers Groove Entertainment Corp. is a combination of all this. It is an organisation that encompasses the field of fashion, hospitality, media and entertainment leading to the birth of several companies under the same wing.
                <br><br>
                <b>Did you face any societal condemnation as you pursued something that was totally different from your degree?</b><br>
                Coming from an African background, our society has a totally different way of viewing education and careers. For instance, in the case where one is doing art and another a doctor, the latter is always taken seriously as compared to the former because they believe education has to be one’s source of success and anything outside isn’t necessarily career and they ask you to get a job you studied for. Luckily enough, currently it’s becoming easier to explain the concept of “art pays” to them unlike during our time. I was almost crucified for getting into the art field after spending 4 years in school studying Microbiology and Biotechnology despite having struggled in Nairobi looking for employment in various companies. Funny enough, some would tell you to go back to school and study in order to get other necessary qualifications for their jobs! That’s when I decided to fully focus on Gamers Groove Entertainment Corp.
                <br><br>
                <b>Where do you see your efforts taking you in the future? Not just as someone who holds a biotech degree, but also as someone who started Gamers Groove Entertainment Corp.?</b>
                Well, growth is gradual and dreaming big has no boundaries. Gamers Groove Entertainment Corp. is a community project. It was founded on the grounds of providing service & opportunities to the society at large. All the companies under Gamers franchise aim at providing opportunities to journalism, hospitality, fashion, tourism, art & social studies/ program students from every corner of the nation and once that is achieved, only then will I have entered a future. There is success in the future not failure! 
                <br><br>
                <b>What advice would you give to students who would want to follow in the same footsteps?</b><br>
                When you join campus, be ready to network. You are going to be uncomfortable but be ready to network and step out of your comfort zone. Whether what you choose to do is in line with your career or not, pursue it and appreciate the strides you make.

                <br><br>
                I don’t know about you, but my greatest takeaway from Maureen’s story is that I can achieve anything my mind conceives and believes to be possible despite whatever obstacles that threaten my journey; besides, if it’s ever too easy then something is clearly wrong. The only limit is myself and that enough is never really enough. This is HER.
