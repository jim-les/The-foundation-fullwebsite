            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                The world is rapidly changing, that’s a fact.To put this into perspective,  a few years ago, the adoption of remote work and online learning was very minimal, the pandemic came along and in a matter of  months, online classes and remote work  became widely adopted.  Key to this adoption are digital skills. 
<br><br>
                UNESCO defines digital skills as ‘a range of abilities to use digital devices, communication applications, and networks to access and manage information. They enable people to create and share digital content, communicate and collaborate, and solve problems for effective and creative self-fulfillment in life, learning, work, and social activities.’
                <br><br>
                Digital skills are diverse; while coding is an example of digital skills, that’s not all there is; data analysis, digital marketing, graphic design and Search Engine Optimization are all examples of digital skills
                <br><br>
                As more and more people go online to research, seek out information and purchase, companies of all shapes and sizes need people that know how to operate, promote and communicate online. Digital skills are crucial for people who want to thrive and succeed in the rapidly evolving world of work. 
                <br><br>
                According to the International Finance Corporation(IFC), by 2030, 50-55 percent of all jobs in Kenya will require digital skills, driven by a thriving ICT sector and start-up ecosystem and resulting in strong growth in the demand for digital skills across the country. 
                <br><br>
                Currently, there are widespread efforts to ensure more and more people take up digital skills. Most recently, the ministry of ICT committed to training 20 million kenyans in digital skills as part of the National Digital Master Plan. 
                <br><br>
                Aside from this, organizations such as Mastercard Foundation, Microsoft, IBM, Meta and Google have free online training on Digital Skills. 
                <br><br>
                As there continues to be rapid evolution and disruption of careers and the world of work, the  experts foresee a  world where digital skills will no longer be nice to haves’ but must haves’. 
                <br><br>
                In light of the above, here is how you can best prepare to thrive. You know that proverb that mentions something about making hay while the sun shines? Well here’s how you can go about that; 
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                Some of the top sites to gain digital skills ( coursera, Google Digital Skills, udemy, watch YT Videos, LinkedIn Learning) 
                <br><br>
                3 things you can do right now
                Identify the skills you want to learn; take some time to research the skills you would like to acquire. This will help you narrow down to an area of study and resources. If you are having a hard time figuring out what digital skill to acquire, the following framework can be helpful. The course should lie at the intersection of your interests, market demands and emerging trends. If the skill checks at least two of the boxes, you can invest time in taking it. When it comes to skill, there is no one size fits all solution although there are basics for example the ability to use word processing software like Google Docs or Microsoft Word cuts across all industries. So do communication skills. 
                <br><br>
                Enroll in an online course; The next step is looking for online courses on the skill you would like to learn. When it comes to payments, there are mainly two types; paid courses and free courses. If you can afford the fee, go for the paid courses. If you are really interested in taking the paid course, consider checking if they have scholarship options available and apply for one. There are also plenty of quality courses that are free of charge. In the rare occasion that you can't find a course that fully covers the skill you want to learn, a helpful strategy would be to widen or narrow the specificity of the skill. If enrolling in an online course isn't an option for you, you can consider watching online tutorials on the subject matter. 
                <br><br>
                Find a way to exercise and share what you learn; the best way to learn and retain what we learn is to learn by doing. This can be done through giving yourself mini exercises to gauge your level of proficiency in the skill. For instance, if you want to learn writing, you can challenge yourself to write say 500 words a day. When done consistently, this allows you to exercise and grow your skill. Don't be afraid of making mistakes, they are part of the process. Another useful tip is to share the process; you can write about it, create a youtube channel on the same. Nothing beats learning by doing.  
                <br><br>
                The internet has brought about access to tons of information, we have a lot more information than our ancestors could have ever dreamt of. It is up to us to make the most of the information and upskilling is one way to do that. 
                In a way, the illiterate of the 21st century are no longer those who can’t read/write but those who can't learn fast enough.
