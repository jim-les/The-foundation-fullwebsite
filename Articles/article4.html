                If KUCCPS had its way, then probably journalist Brian George would be serving executive hotel tables and Engineer Julie Mumbi would probably be serving the nation through KenGen and not the German program, Afrika Kommt! It doesn’t sound like a tragedy, until you hear the statistics of people who live life hating their jobs. My failure to mention the Bill Gates and Barack Obamas of the world, is not a show of remission, but a deliberate attempt to show that the choice of unconventional paths, isn't so distant from each of us, nor is it guaranteed to take everyone to such heights.
                For a moment, think about your college coursework… would you be truly satisfied, doing that same thing for the rest of your life? I may not hear your response, but if research by Brighter Monday, in Kenya and Staff Squared in the UK, is anything to go by, then the NO’s would be resounding. In both cases, employee satisfaction or lack thereof, was one of the biggest determinants of willingness to drop jobs. Jobs which, by the book, they were qualified for, academically. This begs for a deeper look into the conventional pattern of career progression and why people would dread their work after years of practice and preparation.
                Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs theory ranks the need for self actualization at the top of the pyramid of needs. Many assume this to mean it is the least of needs, but I like to think of it as the pyramid depicts it; as most acute. It is a need that can keep one awake at 2am. Make one forego every other need below it on the pyramid. Or better yet, as Disney puts it; call your name as the ocean calls Moana! Hence, as much as the need for food on the table, clothes on one’s back, assurance of a stable future, a social standing and all may be indeed pressing, the need to do what a man was made to do, will still reign supreme. My father, who is a designer at heart, likes to say (much to our disappointment); If it looks good, then we must have it, even if people must have it hungry.
                Probably by now, your love for music, or obsession with tech has nudged at you. That’s precisely why I’m here. You’ve probably done nothing about your inherent passions, because they don’t pay as well today, or how will people (especially your parents) will   <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  think of you, or you don’t know what exactly to do about it, or like many of us, the system landed you in a different world, in which you have learnt to adjust. All valid. Times are tough, or in popular Kenyan lingo, maneno ni mengi, masaa ni machache.
                However, let me draw your attention to a generation of people, who lived and died for a dream, the Baby Boomers. A time of ‘inventions that changed’ the world. One might reckon that times were easier then. This is why in this issue, we look at the examples of  individuals who have done just that, in this era, and what that journey has been like;
<br>
                i) What's your career journey story? <br>
                N: I studied law at UON. I never wanted to be a lawyer, nor think I’d go as far as KSL but chose the course because it didn’t seem difficult. My dream was to do a media-related course, but it wasn’t considered ‘high-end’. After my undergraduate,I was really conflicted about continuing but God changed my heart about it, and I ended up seeing it through to pupilage, which I did at a law firm and got admitted to the bar. This whole time, I had been doing music on the side and my heart was in it completely. Though it was a hard balance to strike, I knew I wanted to be in the entertainment world for the rest of my life. So after my pupillage, I quit my job at the firm to teach voice and guitar lessons, before I got a job as a show host with Kubamba, to do ministry, music and communication.
                <br><br>
                O; My career as a sportsman started in highschool where I played rugby. As fate would have it, I joined the UON to study a Bsc. in Chemistry. After highschool I set out to continue with the sport, hoping to make the Kenyan under 20’s rugby team, but was unsuccessful. It was following this set back that I decided(on advice by a friend) to venture into athletics. I admit, I always felt too fast for the pitch. The journey rising through the athletic ladder has not been a walk in the park.
                <br><br>
                *****ii) What were the steps that led you to making unconventional decisions, when did you decide to opt out of your area of study (if you did)?
                N: Everyday I worked at the law firm, I felt that it wasn’t purposeful. Drafting documents and doing research, in an office at 8am everyday, was neither boring nor unmaneageable. But it didn;t feel like I was living in purpose. So I started by taking the opportunities that were within reach to do what I loved, having made the decision to go after my passions. I also utilized my networks; I got music students by referral and the job to work with Kubamba since I had worked with them before on events and missions 
                <br><br>
                O: I did what I liked and gave it my all. I trained hard and sought out opportunities to compete. Eventually my star began to rise.
                <br><br>
                iii) What were the risks involved and how did you navigate them?
                <br><br>
                N:The first risk was on income. I would definitely be making more money if I had a job at an institution. The income in this field is not as regular.Another risk was that my parents had invested a lot of money into my education. They need to see value in what I am doing now, so that it doesn’t seem like I am throwing all that to the wind. Thirdly, the career path isn’t so clear, unlike in an institution where you can tell how long you will be there, how you can improve your qualification to increase your income, etc. Here, you have to create your own path. I navigate them by encouraging myself everyday,because there are days I really question myself. I remind myself that I am where I need to be, I can do this, I am enabled by God to do it, so let me not dwell in fear and it’s worth it; every bit of the experience.
                <br><br>
                O: The risks then and even now, is the likelihood to not effectively continue to juggle other responsibilities of life.  How I navigate is by going ahead and taking the risk and striving to strike a balance. I also have a very strong support system.
                <br><br>
                iv) When is your passion worth dropping everything for?
                <br><br>
                N: I feel like it’s when you are completely convinced that it is the best decision for you, and if you believe in Jesus, that happens when you hear an instruction from God, because we live under His guidance. We don’t stumble into destiny  So when you are persuaded that it’s His will. Because when you are very passionate about something and God’s will is that you remain in a different place, then you have to believe that that is God’s best for you, at least for the season.
                <br><br>
                O: Life will take its course, things will fall in place. As you pursue what you love and get more opportunities, every other thing will naturally shed off.
                <br><br>
                v) Your remarks to students and Gen-Zs on such cross roads?
                <br><br>
                N: Weigh the pros and cons, introspect; are you willing to bear the cost of chasing your dreams. If you are completely sold out to it, then take that bold step.
                <br><br>
                O: You should never give up on your dreams no matter how hard life’s blows get. Keep up the hard work, it will pay off one day.
                <br><br>

                There you have it folks! (insert Jeff Koinange’s voice). The ball is in your court. I say, choose love, whichever way you can, as soon as you can.
