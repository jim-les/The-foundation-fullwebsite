                Well-being. A word that is obviously not foreign to any of us. Although I am pretty certain, if not absolutely, that if I were to corner you along the streets of the University of Nairobi and ask you what exactly the whole well-being concept refers to, you would probably stutter. True or true? Don’t worry comrade, I got you. At least, Wikipidiea got you, allow me to give credit where it’s due lest the plagiarism cops catch up with me! According to our already mentioned friend, well-being, also known as wellness, prudential value or quality of life refers to what is intrinsically valuable relative to someone; so the well-being of a person is what is ultimately good for this person in their own self-interest. Alright Wikipedia, we get the gist of your intelligence but let’s take it down a notch and simply refer to the whole concept as the state of being okay; okay in all aspects of one's life from the simplest to more complex scenarios. Quite literally. In this article, I shall focus on the mental aspect of wellbeing because in all honesty, a combo of uni and the age past adolescence where now you either grow up are don’t is a capital W for whack!
                <br><br>
                Trust me, when I tell you that I have looked into this  through a number of people’s POVs. They are all undeniably  interesting and uniquely complex in their own right. However, allow me to share my own POV, won’t you? I’ll just put it out there, plain and simple, I attended my first therapy session. I’m so tempted to add, “crazy, right?” to my confession, but that is exactly what we are not trying to do. Relating the step towards consciously taking care of our mental well-being to the more negative adjectives. Crazy, weird, strange, unusual, insane; you name it. May I say that this is one of the reasons I absolutely love our generation and the odds of me tattooing the title Gen-Z on my forehead are quite high. Alright, pause, I might have exaggerated but you get what I’m saying. 
                <br><br>
                When it comes to mental health, mental-wellbeing and wellness, we are the number one advocates of the same. I appreciate the fact that it is an everyday learning curve for us when it comes to unlearning our childhood beliefs and the traits we either knowingly or unknowingly adopted from those around us during our various upbringings. This is especially the case when it comes to seemingly “trivial” matters, like how we’re feeling and how we react to certain situations. I’m sure we all had that finger pointed at us more than once with the very common scolding of, wacha kulia, unalia nini, nitakuchapa ukiendelea kulia. Or at least something along those lines. But who is Gen-Z? Our feelings are valid and we’re always making that  effort to intentionally express them and seek help whenever we can’t put a name to the emotion or navigate what we are going through.
                <br><br>
                I think with that background it answers the question of why I chose to seek therapy. I have always known it exists, but like many of us, I unfairly preserved it for the more privileged or on the other spectrum, the “mentally unstable” as a less open -minded person would term those who seek the service. Even with that knowledge, that was not what influenced me to reach out to somebody for help. I recently caught up with my friend John and he shared with me his own experience with a therapist and I knew at that moment that that is exactly what I needed. Someone to listen to me. Note that this person is not just listening, but listening to understand, rather than listening to respond. This person is not judging me in any type of way and he/she is definitely not trying to give me solutions to my predicaments. I mean yes, I have friends and family who are always there for me, as do you, but sometimes a stranger works the magic in creating that safe space; and that is all I needed, a safe space. We are all deserving of one.
                <br><br>
                Here is the funniest thing about my first session. It might seem like the massive technological advancements are overrated but I came to debunk that when I met my therapist on Tiktok, of all places, an app originally designed to serve the purpose of entertainment. It started almost like the one too many relationships nowadays where she had absolutely good vibes on my comment section in a video I posted, then of course I followed her back and interacting with her content was nothing but magnetic. You are probably guessing what happened next. Before I tell you, where in the world is that “slide” emoji. I shot my shot by sliding in her DM reciprocating her energy and I didn’t slack to book a session with her. In those relationships I mentioned, we would call it “love at first text”. When I say I received healing just from a one-hour virtual conversation, you best believe it was the divine type of healing. No cap!
                <br><br>
                I am looking forward to checking in with her on a regular basis. Here are some affirmations she shared with me that I simply cannot keep to myself:
                <br><br>
                It’s  really hard for me right now, and that’s okay.
                It’s really hard for me right now, and I can find ways to get better.
                <br><br>
                If there is one thing that comes between us and our growth towards achieving mental wellness, it is the lack of acceptance of our hard situations. I know that we have been cultured to be ‘gangster’ about a lot of things, but I hope we are all choosing to leave that misleading notion behind. We need to muster the courage to face our difficulties head on and say it straight to their faces that, “Hey, I see you, and I feel you even more, and that is totally okay because I am a human being and I cannot always be 100. But you know what, I am stronger than you and I will defeat you, despite me needing some time to gather all that strength. So for now, I might be at 60, perhaps 30, but I am handling it because I am constantly seeking means through which I can be myself again. So thank you for giving me this opportunity to grow.”
                <br><br>
                Read that again.
                <br><br>
                With that, this is my call to all of us to fein from shying away from seeking help. Own your feelings, own your wellness, you are deserving of peace and joy. Anything that brings you down might seem enormous but with another hand pulling you up, nothing is undefeatable. The University of Nairobi has made this one of their core values by providing free guidance and counseling to students who might need it. This is through the dean of students’ office where the assistant deans are trained counselors and have experience in helping students facing different challenges. To add to that, I would recommend that we tune in to the O3Plus Podcast which was done by the University of Nairobi in partnership with UNESCO, with each 65 episodes aiming to create awareness around student well-being. We also have an app that is quite famous around campus called Radar where you could seek assistance online whenever you are faced with a difficulty. As a student community, we are privileged to have such services and we should take full advantage of them.
                <br><br>
                Of course, there is no harm in going the other route and seeking external assistance. There are lots of institutions outside the school that offer help to students, one being the Kenyatta National Hospital which provides anyone who is  student and under the age of 25 with free therapy for as long as you need it. I know this thanks to my friend John, remember him? And sometimes, the help we need is right there on our little devices that we have become so addicted to. Our phones. Let’s optimize what we consume to a level that benefits our mental well-being rather than deteriorate it. I mean, look at me, I will forever be grateful to Tiktok. What do they say? Knock the door and it shall be opened? Let’s try relating that to reaching out for that help. We will be okay.
