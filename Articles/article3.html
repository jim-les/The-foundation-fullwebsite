                <h2>Feature Story of Dr. Maureen Nafula</h2>
<br><br>
                Ever met someone you automatically admired and gawked over sheepishly? Maureen Nafula is that person for me. I would accredit her magnetic aura or perhaps her enchanting smile but there’s a whole lot more to that. Seriously, hear me out. She’s the type of person who is simply not convinced that any amount of knowledge or experience can ever be enough. This has motivated her to try out different things without being afraid of failure, keeping in mind that the world isn’t ending and it has given us a whole playing field to fall, get up, fall again a bit harder, and eventually get up and stay up. 
                <br><br>               
                You know us ladies and our preference to not share our ages, right? For that reason, allow me to keep that bit of information about Maureen from you.  Born is year x, her family moved to Nairobi from Bungoma town during her pre-teens, where they eventually settled in the East-Leigh neighborhood, despite her father being a civil servant, his monthly income was simply not enough to cater for their day to day needs back at home and that is how her mother Mary got into small side jobs to at least put food on the table daily. Maureen fondly recalls learning how to stitch sweaters together with her nine other siblings and hawking them to passers by back in the day. How humble! Maureen confidently describes herself as being book smart topping up on the massive street smartness she gained throughout her childhood struggles. This was quite evident in her KCSE and KCPE performances which by the way, she made it to the papers which obviously made everyone proud, especially her folks. Being an elder sister gave her the default role of being a trailblazer to her younger sibling and she played that role quite fittingly. 
                <br><br>               
                Clearing highschool with a clean A gave her a direct pass to the University of Nairobi, in which she chose to pursue Pharmacy, officially earning herself the title Doctor after successfully completing her degree. When I first met her I addressed her as Dr. (insert her husband’s last name) and I have never been more impressed in my life than when she rebuked me for calling her that. She insisted that her name is Dr. Nafula since she slaved and labored for that degree herself and I just had to give her the respect she deserves. 
                <br><br>               
                I suppose it is expected that she later mastered in pharmacy but joke’s on you! She mastered in finance. Yup! Major plot twist! When I asked her why she chose finance of all courses she said that she wanted an edge in the business world which was quite reasonable. If you are like me, you must be thinking that she intended to start some sort of pharmaceutical business, but again, joke’s on you. She has been running a whole restaurant. Well, this is not entirely out of character for her  since she is one of the best chefs I know; let’s not even start on her pastries because I don’t need you staining this article with drool. Tuuti’s is located in the heart of Bungoma town where her together and her husband have built their retirement home. Of course being located in her hometown you can imagine all the delicious dishes that represent the place starting with the almighty ingokho. Her second-born son helps her run the business as he is the main chef and her eldest son manages the accounts and finance. Tuuti’s has had ups and downs during its operating years, for example a few money issues here and there, but that never put Maureen down. Remember, she got into this business being financially literate which gave her an advantage in turning the situation around despite the block.
                <br><br>              
                Where do you suppose she lept to next? Agriculture! I was surprised when we last talked and Maureen told me that she is now a farmer. In fact, these were her exact words, “When you visit me in Bungoma you’ll probably be told that I am in the shamba and you’ll find me busy at my farm” Phenomenal if you ask me. She says that this way she is able to supply produce to Tuuti’s   hence being more self-reliant and conscious of the type of food prepared at her restaurant. I should probably link the exact location somewhere here.
                <br><br>             
                She has done all of this, of course with the failures that she encountered numerous times but my biggest question for her was how everything linked up? Aren’t you just as curious. The level of respect I already had for her immediately skyrocketed when she mentioned that she has been recruited not once, but an uncountable number of times by both government and other internationally recognized organizations as a health-agricultural food consultant. This is literally everything she has done before. And guess what? Maureen is just getting started.
                <br><br>              
                I don’t know about you, but my greatest takeaway from Maureen’s story is that I can achieve anything my mind conceives and believes to be possible despite whatever obstacles that threaten my journey; besides, if it’s ever too easy then something is clearly wrong. The only limit is myself and that enough is never really enough. This is HER.
