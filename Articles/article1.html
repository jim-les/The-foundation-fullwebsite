            <p>
                Never in my wildest imagination did I think I would be ashamed of the career I chose to follow; just because my parents, friends and even strangers I owe nothing claim is not good enough. 
<br><br>
                Never in my wildest imagination did I think I would give up my passion to fulfil my parent’s dream because for some reason they decided that having their blood is not enough. They have to live their unfulfilled aspirations through me.
                <br><br>            
                Never in my wildest imagination did I think I would end up being a Content Creator which is just a fancy term to describe You-Tubers, Tik-Tokers, Instagram Influencers and everything in between. 
                <br><br>             
                Never in my wildest imagination did I think I would be literally begging for views on people’s Whatsapp pages just because I'm insecure about my content not getting enough views. Please STOP that. Invest in making good content. People will appreciate it more. 
                <br><br>            
                The story of my life in four paragraphs, how touching. My words see your judgement because you feel you are better than me and that is fine. I am content. For my success does not feed off validation from the people around me. Rather, from the happiness I derive from what I do and you bet I am good at it. 
                <br><br>             
                I lived like you. I can even go as far as to say I was you. I never really had options growing up because of the environment I was exposed to.I was told the only way to be successful was to work myself to the bone to be a Doctor, Lawyer or Engineer.
                <br><br>             
                I don’t really get the infatuation among the three careers which also goes for the idea that you need to be rich to be successful. We all want a better life than the one we have, but don’t you think we are equating our entire existence to having money rather than thriving in personal interests?
                <br><br>             
                While you’re thinking about that, the mindset fed to us from Baby Boomers, Gen X to Millennials as well as a big chunk of the early Gen Z’s  is quite hard to change but not impossible. The key argument that tilts the scale in favor of having a white collar career to be successful is the actual evidence of the success. 
                <br><br>             
                Our great grandparents, grandparents as well as our parents achieved success through this formula and so as loving and caring as they are, they forced it down our throats. Is it their fault? No. Because they didn’t know any better. You can only give as much as you have.However, the world has changed and this excuse is not holding enough water.
                <br><br>             
                The information revolution that has taken place over the past two decades has brought about a new reality to the world especially in terms of career choices. Gen Z’s are realising that their passion is worth more fighting for than a boring desk job with a fat paycheck. 
                <br><br>             
                Millennials are envious of the choices Gen Z are privileged to make in their careers  which shows that a part of them wish they had known better. Gen X might call us irresponsible and immature but guess what Dr. Profession, I get to make more money than you can ever dream of by just posting my morning routine.
                <br><br>          
                Success is what you make it to be and not a social construct that we were made to believe. 
                <br><br>          
                Be the painter you always wanted to be ; because day by day you are changing the world with your art.
                <br><br>          
                Be the influencer you always wanted to be ; because day by day you have the power to influence masses to make positive changes to the world.
                <br><br>          
                Be the make-up artist and manicurist you always wanted to be ; because day by day you are boosting someone’s confidence.
                <br><br>         
                Be the dancer you always wanted to be; because day by day you are breaking bones we wish we could.
                <br><br>         
                However, always remember that the path you choose will not be without adversity and that’s life. So live it! Don’t Exist.
