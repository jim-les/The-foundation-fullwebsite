        </h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                I don’t know about you but I didn’t have money. I wish I had, but I didn’t. So I looked for horses because I wanted to ride one so badly. 
                <br><br>
                However, on the other hand I also  wanted to own my own horse rather than depend on a stable boy to lend it to me every now and then. Time will eventually catch up with me and at my 24th birthday, I will be out in the world and my stable boy won’t be so friendly. 
                <br><br>
                So I sought out to get my horse by starting a movie shop at “Klabu”. It was the best idea I had come up with. Less capital and definitely marketable to students. However, two months in, business was down and I really didn’t feel like persevering. 
                <br><br>
                After my failed business, I concluded that I was not cut out for self employment and so I decided to get a job. It wasn’t easy. Who will employ a 23 year old boy with zero experience in anything? However, luckily I got one. Bussing tables at a local bar from 8:00pm till morning. 
                <br><br>
                My job was stressful to say the least and even though the money was good, I guess there comes a point in your life when the bag is not worth the chase. I was missing classes, had a near nervous breakdown due to lack of sleep and I was slowly developing a sweet tooth for hard liquor.
                <br><br>
                Unto my third horse, the scam that is online jobs. My friend got me into academic writing which I thought would be a fresh start. Minimal financial risks and flexible working hours. A gem to be honest; but one day, I just snapped. The pressure was too much for something that you don’t even enjoy doing and that is when I realised that I was chasing the wrong horses all this time.
                <br><br>
                I asked myself, what do I like to do? What brings me joy?. At first I didn’t have an answer, I mean I liked KFC chicken; absolutely divine!But while I was doing my daily workout, it hit me that I could be a fitness trainer. So anti-climatic don’t you think? Where is the sad backstory of not feeling good about yourself? Where is the dramatic flavour?  I guess I'm that boring but this is real life.
                <br><br>
                I had been working out for almost a year by then and my abs were popping out one by one. Was I the fitness guru that you see on YouTube with an entire gym set up? Of course not. I don’t have money for expensive equipment, heck! I don’t have money at all but that was my advantage and I milked it for all it’s worth.
                <br><br>
                I exploited the fact that there were no fitness trainers who actually looked more like the average human being rather than superman and leveraged it for authenticity. My viewers got to see themselves in me as an unfit young man who loves the crunchier side of life but also hopes for a banging fit body.
                <br><br>
                Two years down the line, I got monetized on YouTube, leased a gym space and now working as a fitness trainer on the side as my law degree sits in the offices of hundreds of law firms in Nairobi. 
                <br><br>
                So what? If wishes were horses, you better get your own.
