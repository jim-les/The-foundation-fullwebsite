                A jack of all trades, Danstan tells us what it has been like redefining the stereotypes of what an engineer should be. From starting a fashion line to dabbling in media production, we discussed how he dabbled in what seemed like opposing fields to his major: Electrical Engineering.
                <br><br>
                <b>How did you find yourself in the school of engineering</b> <br>
                It started when I was a kid. I would get barbed wire and make little toys, or get bulbs from bicycles and old cars and use them. Later I built my own electrical system to light up my own bedroom. I would often get into trouble for picking radios apart (laughs). Physics came easy to me while in highschool, it was almost second to nature for me. I also had a mentor who had worked at Sony Ericsson who advised me that electrical engineering would help me better discover myself. I would say all these experiences led me to pursuing electrical engineering.
                <br> <br>
                <b>How did you find yourself creating a fashion line while pursuing an engineering degree?</b> <br>
                I used to attend different events around campus that I would come across on the notice boards. Through that, I discovered different events that I loved attending as it allowed me to meet different people from different courses, people from outside school, those from the professional fields. At these events, people would commend my unique style. People would tell me they love my dressing. Through that I became aware of the fact that people are more than willing to pay for it too.So if people told me they wanted something, I would customise it according to their preferences. That’s where it started.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Not only did you manage a fashion line, but also get into production and photography work. How did you manage to venture out into all this while pursuing a demanding degree such as electrical engineering?</b> <br>
                Engineering is demanding but it also depends on how you manage your time. For me, classes would run from May to December. We'd have a long holiday otherwise. During that time, I  would explore my line and build up my clientele. I would also spend my evenings during the semester focusing on my other pursuits. For example, on Tuesdays, we would attend audio visual meetings between 7 and 8. That’s when I met a lot of people who taught me about photography and editing. One of them was Daniel Nandi, who would take pictures for the church and they would require volunteers. That was a way for me to not only learn but to also build my clientele. It wasn't a big photography company and it didn’t really require much management but it was a way for me to pay my bills. Most events often took place on weekends which made it easier too. It wasn’t as demanding but whenever it got as such I always found it helpful to plan my time in such a way that it wouldn’t interfere with school time.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Did you ever receive any backlash for doing something other than your engineering degree? </b> <br>
                I did receive the backlash but as time went on and people realised that there is much more to you than the stereotypes of what an engineer should be and relate to you from a deeper core, it always lead to something better eventually
                <br> <br>
                <b> What would you say to students who may want to follow in similar footsteps, that is, to do something in another field while pursuing a degree in a different field? </b><br>
                My belief is that education is always supposed to make you discover yourself and bring out the better side of you. Be diverse enough to share your values with the rest of the world. Whatever one is doing shouldn’t inhibit them from diversifying.
