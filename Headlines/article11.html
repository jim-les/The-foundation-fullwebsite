            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                Several conversations around employability of graduates today take the direction of the proverbial prophet of doom, as far as academic qualification is concerned. The narrative is that times have changed. There’s an influx of college degrees. Talent sells above papers. Graduates are half-baked. COVID-19 wrote-off many professions, and other short stories. Let us first admit that there is some truth in all that.
                Times have indeed changed; what was once a knowledge based economy, that rewarded high school graduates with a great experience in tertiary institutions and promised stable or permanent employment, is now largely skill-based.(A skill-based economy is one where a niche skill-set for a particular job is considered to give individuals the bigger edge, whereas a knowledge economy is one where knowledge is the key asset). That means that none of the things that were true for those who made it past secondary school then, are true now. One is not guaranteed a place at the best institutions, nor is it heavenly there, for those who make it (especially with the peaks in the costs of living). Least of all, is it a guarantee for employment. 
<br><br>
                According to statista.com, 14% of the Kenyan populace aged between 15-29, hold a post- secondary qualification, while the unemployment rate was 6.6% as at 2021. We can safely conclude that there are several people with papers that are yet to translate into a pension. What greater predicament could befall the most knowledgeable generation (millenials and under), than a skill based-economy. Add a COVID-19 pandemic to the equation and you spell disaster. ResearchED, in an article published by New York Times, confirms that Millenials are the ‘most educated’ lot, compared to all their predecessors.Theirs was a time of increased value for education and arguably more enabling prevailing circumstances, such as gender inclusion and availability of student loans and more institutions of higher learning. This trend has been on an upward trajectory for Gen Zs, with universities admitting students to the tunes of half a million every year in Kenya.
                It is against this bleak background that we then ask ourselves; considering the economic principle of supply and demand, is pursuing a degree certificate still worth it, if a job is the desired end? And even further, a decorated certificate. I reckon that the greater predicament would be a frantic reaction to these realities. Let’s first consider, the pros of having a degree;
                <br><br>
                Most employers still consider it a requirement.<br>
                According to a survey conducted by Corporate Staffing Services, having a degree certificate can open doors for you, though it may not directly translate to a job opportunity. The report indicated that about 53% of the employers consider your education when hiring while 49.4% look at other experiences acquired in school.
                <br><br>
                Tertiary education does more than just prepare one for employment.<br>
                At the risk of sounding cliche,let me remind us of the graduation declaration, that one is given the powers to read and write. An undergraduate degree is meant to set one off on the learning highway of life and other levels of academia. When we think of it that way, it becomes less of a wonder that many people work jobs that they did not study for. Einstein phenomenally puts it as, Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school. 
                <br>So take that degree anyway; there’s no pride in being uneducated. 
                <br><br>
                It sets you ahead of the pack, a bit.
                <br><br>
                When a job only needs soft skills, then getting someone with technical skills of any kind, is a plus for any company. It is also proven that those with a higher level of education are able to do more, think wider and last longer. It behooves people to note that if the state of the economy goes south (tanks, or goes into recession), those who possess more academic credentials will weather the storm a bit better (statistically-speaking) than those with less academic achievement. 
                <br><br>
                Now that we have established that there is every reason to take up a college degree, let’s see how to make up for the shortcomings;
                <br><br>
                Know what the industry is looking for, now and in the near future.<br>
                It would only be foolish to board a flight to the Amazon rainforest and fail to carry an umbrella. So would it be to sit pretty through your course, without knowing what your destination looks like and preparing for it. And since times are changing pretty fast, it's wiser to analyze and know where your industry is likely to go in a few years, then equip yourself for that future. That way you become indispensable!
                <br><br>
                Gain skills and networks<br>
                I cannot belabor the urgency of gaining relevant skills. Luckily for you, this issue has more information on that, so let’s speak on the networks. Networking might be overrated these days, but I’d define it as simply forging good relations with people. Create rapport. Create a bridge through which you can reach out to people and vice versa. That’s an uphill task, considering the fact that we live in a generation that prides in building dikes around themselves and “cutting people off”. However, relationships are going to earn you more than your degree, that’s for sure.
                <br><br>
                Be creative, but get guidance through it.<br>
                If necessity is still the mother of all invention, then she has never been more expectant than she is now! Before I ask you to think outside the box, I encourage you to find out where exactly the box is first. Many millennials have set out on paths unbeaten, only to come back crying foul. Blaming systems, blaming haters, blaming Kenyans for not supporting local content, et al. The principles of mentorship and growth won’t bend because a generation is aggressive and hot headed. Not that it’s entirely wrong, but at least play by the rules; learn the ropes under someone, then go out there and break a leg.
                <br><br>
                So do the papers count? If you make them!
